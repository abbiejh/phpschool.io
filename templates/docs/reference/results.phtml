<p>After a student's solution has been verified, the result set is rendered to the console. The result set is
made up of several individual results. Verification is deemed to have failed if any one of those results is a failure.
Each result represents a different thing, for example, each check will likely inject a result in to the result set. The
    output verification will be a single result, the parsing of the file will be a single result, and so on.</p>

<p>Each Result class has an associated renderer, the renderers job is to take the information from the result and render
in to the console.</p>

<p>Results are what <a href="/docs/reference/exercise-checks">Exercise Checks</a> should return and inject. You will
learn more about how to actually use the results in your checks in a
    <a href="/docs/reference/exercise-checks">later article</a>.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('result-set', 'The Result Set') ?>

<p>The result set is an instance of <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultAggregator</code> and results are added to it
with <code>add(ResultInterface $result)</code>. Note the interface
    <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\ResultInterface</code>. Every result must implement this interface.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('success-or-failure', 'Success or Failure?') ?>
<p>So, how do we know if a result is a success or failure? Well there are two other interfaces, extending from
<code>ResultInterface</code>, which are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\SuccessInterface</code></li>
    <li><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\FailureInterface</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these interfaces add no extra methods, they are purely for determining whether a result is considered
a success or failure.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('result-interface', 'Result Interface') ?>
<p>The interface for <code>ResultInterface</code> is very simple:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php

interface ResultInterface
{
    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function getCheckName();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method should just return the name of the check associated with this result. This is used when rendering the
result to the console.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('implementations', 'Implementations') ?>
<p>There are default implementations for <code>SuccessInterface</code> & <code>FailureInterface</code> for you to use
in your checks. If you need something more bespoke to render the failure of your check, you should
<a href="/docs/reference/creating-custom-results">create your own</a>.</p>

<h3 id="success">PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\Success</h3>
<p>As you saw from the interface, the only required piece of information is the check name. So construction
would look like the following.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php

use PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\Success;

$success = new Success('My Check');
</code></pre>

<p>If you are within a Check (eg <code>$this</code> refers to <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Check\CheckInterface</code>)
then you can use the static constructor <code>fromCheck(CheckInterface $check)</code> which just pulls the check
name from the actual check for convenience.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php

namespace PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Check;

use PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Exercise\ExerciseInterface;
use PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\Success;

class MyCheck implements SimpleCheckInterface
{
    ...snip

    public function check(ExerciseInterface $exercise, $fileName)
    {
        return Success::fromCheck($this);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="failure">PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\Failure</h3>
<p>The default implementation of <code>FailureInterface</code> needs one more piece of information
other than the check name: the reason for the failure. Construction is fairly similar:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php

use PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\Failure;

//constructor
$failure = new Failure('My Check', 'Something went wrong!');

//static constructor
$failure = Failure::fromNameAndReason('My Check', 'Something went wrong!');

//static constructor with check
$myCheck = new MyCheck;
$failure = Failure::fromCheckAndReason($check, 'Something went wrong!');
</code></pre>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('failure-implementations', 'Bundled Failure Implementations') ?>
<p>There are a number of <code>FailureInterface</code> implementations bundled with the framework
for some of the other checks:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\CgiOutRequestFailure</code></li>
    <li><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\FunctionRequirementsFailure</code></li>
    <li><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\StdOutFailure</code></li>
</ul>


<?= $this->renderContentHeader('custom-results', 'Custom Results') ?>
<p>When you want to report information that is not simple a message, you will need to create
your own result class. If you would build a check that verifies the contents of a database, you may want to provide a
list of missing records as an array instead of just a message. You would then write a renderer that may render each row
as a new line with a bullet point preceding it. Learn how to create your own checks
    <a href="/docs/reference/creating-custom-results">in a later article</a>.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('result-renderer-interface', 'Result Renderers') ?>

<p>Each result renderer must implement the interface <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\ResultRendererInterface</code> which looks like
    below.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-php">&lt;?php

namespace PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer;

use PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\ResultInterface;

interface ResultRendererInterface
{

    /**
     * @param ResultsRenderer $renderer
     * @return string
     */
    public function render(ResultsRenderer $renderer);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultAggregator</code> is rendered by <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\ResultsRenderer</code>. It loops each
result, passing the result to <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Factory\ResultRendererFactory</code> which returns the correct renderer. The
    <code>render</code> method is called and then the output of each is written to the console.</p>

<p>When each renderer is created, it is passed the <code>ResultInterface</code> as the first constructor
argument. <code>render</code> is called with an instance of <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\ResultsRenderer</code> and
it should return a string representation of the <code>ResultInterface</code> instance it was constructed with.</p>

<p><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\ResultsRenderer</code> has some helper methods on it for rendering
    styling:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>style($string, $colourOrStyle)</code> - Use to style a string, eg. <code>bold</code>, <code>green</code>.</li>
    <li><code>lineBreak()</code> - Use to render a line break, to separate content.</li>
</ul>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('result-renderer-mappings', 'Result Renderer Mappings') ?>

<p>The workshop framework picks a result renderer based on the mappings in <code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Factory\ResultRendererFactory</code>.</p>
<p>The default mappings are:</p>

<table class="exercise__type__info">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Result Class</td>
            <td>Result Renderer Class</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\StdOutFailure</code></td>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\OutputFailureRenderer</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\CgiOutResult</code></td>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\CgiOutResultRenderer</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\FunctionRequirementsFailure</code></td>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\FunctionRequirementsFailureRenderer</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\Result\Failure</code></td>
            <td><code>PhpSchool\PhpWorkshop\ResultRenderer\FailureRenderer</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you create a new implementation of <code>FailureInterface</code> you will need to map it to an existing renderer,
or most likely you will need to write a custom renderer, and map it to that.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('summary', 'Summary') ?>
<p>The whole process may sound complicated, however, this is not true. To summarise, your check should return a result.
The result should be mapped to a renderer. The results are rendered by the framework. It will pick the correct renderer
based on the mapping.</p>

<?= $this->renderContentHeader('create-a-result', 'Create a custom result') ?>
<p>In the next set of articles we will learn about and build a check. Once the check is complete, we will
build a custom result and result renderer for it, you can jump
    <a href="/docs/reference/creating-custom-results">straight there if you want</a>.</p>
